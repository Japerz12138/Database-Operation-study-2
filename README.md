# Database operation study 1
 This is an example code for a easy database operation using JForm.

Compile with intelliJ for best results. Although the Maven framework is used, the library needs to be added manually for course demonstration purposes.

The two librarie(s) are:
- mysql-connector-java-8.0.19.jar
- rs2xml.jar

The sql queue file for demonstration is also included, and you can use this file to create the table used in this program in the database.

The sql queue file(s) are:
- doctors_office.sql
